# ðŸŽ¤ Supervoice Vocoder

This is a training scripts of Vocoder model using Supervoice. Supervoice uses HiFiGAN as a vocoder model. We are re-training vocos to make it compatible with more popular Log-Mel spectograms parameters. We have made a small modification - replacing leaky relu with gelu activation function.

## Requirements

This model requires about 1M updates of the network to perform well, this is about 8xGPU for about a week, which costs about 300$ on medium tier cloud provider like paperspace. Dataset is not required to be large and too diverse - vocoders are very good at generalizing. LibriTTS (and "R" variant) is sufficient for the training. We are providing scripts to automatically download required datasets.

## Dependencies

To run this model you need to have the following dependencies installed:

## Datasets

To download datasets you need a [datasets](https://github.com/ex3ndr/datasets) tool installed in your system, then you can download datasets by running:

```bash
datasets sync
```
